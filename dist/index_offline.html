	<h1>Scribbletune in the browser with Tone.js! (offline rendering)</h1>
	<h3>Render offline a scribbletune clip to improve in-browser performance</h3>
	<p>This is a simple demo to show how you can quickly use sounds and synths to play patterns. This HTML file loads Tone.js from CDN and the browser version of Scribbletune as SCRIPT tags. It also loads a file called script_offline.js for using these 2 libraries for generating patterns and playing them. <a href="script_offline.js">Take a look at script_offline.js</a> to see the minimal code written for this demo.</p>
