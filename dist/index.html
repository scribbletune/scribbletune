	<h1>Scribbletune in the browser with Tone.js!</h1>
	<h3>Play samples and synths individually</h3>
	<p>This is a simple demo to show how you can quickly use sounds and synths to play patterns. This HTML file loads Tone.js from CDN and the browser version of Scribbletune as SCRIPT tags. It also loads a file called script.js for using these 2 libraries for generating patterns and playing them. <a href="script.js">Take a look at script.js</a> to see the minimal code written for this demo.</p>
