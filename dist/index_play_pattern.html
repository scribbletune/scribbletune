	<h1>Scribbletune in the browser with Tone.js! (offline rendering & channel patterns playing)</h1>
	<h3>Render offline a scribbletune clip to improve in-browser performance & play channels using patterns like you would do for clips.</h3>
	<p>This is a simple demo to show how you can quickly use sounds and synths to play patterns. This HTML file loads Tone.js from CDN and the browser version of Scribbletune as SCRIPT tags. It also loads a file called script_offline.js for using these 2 libraries for generating patterns and playing them. <a href="script_play_pattern.js">Take a look at script_play_pattern.js</a> to see the minimal code written for this demo.</p>
